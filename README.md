# svg-icons
Use uploaded SVG files as icons

1. Upload your SVG icons to the Saltcorn file store. Set permission to access to public
2. In the configuration for this module, enter your SVG icons. Each has a short identifier (no spaces), and you have to enter the path to the file in the file store. For instance if you have uploaded a file called coffee.svg im the root of the filestore, enter coffee.svg for the SVG file path. In the future we will make it so you pick the file

you may have to restart Saltcorn after editing the module config :-( - this will be fixed.

You should now be able to pick your SVG files as icons in the builder.
